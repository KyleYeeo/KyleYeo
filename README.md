# Passionate MEVN Stack Developer
## Hi, I am Evan Yeo 👋
<p>
Passionate, Collaborative and Highly Skilled Full Stack Web Developer with 6+ years of professional experience in dynamic and deadline-driven work environments. 
I am always trying harder to find new and more effective ways to solve problems.
</p>
I love working through all the stages of development and I place a lot of importance on DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself), well-documented, and easy to-maintain and scalable code.
Communication with the client is a crucial part of web development and I make it a priority to be responsive as well as report regularly on the development process.
